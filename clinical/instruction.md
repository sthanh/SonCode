Instruction for Agents:
1. Frontend Development Tasks
Initialize Next.js and UI Frameworks: Start a Next.js project with TypeScript and integrate Tailwind CSS for styling. Add the ShadCN UI library for a pre-built set of accessible React components (ShadCN provides a CLI to quickly set up Next.js with Tailwind and its UI kit​
UI.SHADCN.COM
). This ensures a consistent design system from the beginning.
Authentication Pages (Sign Up & Login): Create dedicated pages for user registration and login using Supabase Auth. Leverage Supabase’s pre-built authentication features (email/password, OAuth, etc.) so that users can securely sign up and sign in​
SUPABASE.COM
. The pages should include forms for email and password, and handle Supabase’s auth responses (like error messages for wrong credentials or success states).
Design the User Profile Page: Build a profile form where users input their medical history and manage documents:
Include text fields or multi-select inputs for the user’s conditions, past treatments, treatment outcomes, side effects, and reasons for any treatment discontinuation. This allows manual entry of key health history details which will later be used for trial matching.
Implement a file upload component that accepts medical documents (PDFs, text files, images). When a user selects a file, show a real-time preview (e.g., display an image or render a PDF in an iframe) so they can verify the content before saving​
THATSOFTWAREDUDE.COM
. Ensure multiple formats are supported and provide feedback (like file size limits or invalid format warnings).
Implement the Clinical Trial Search Page: Create a search interface where users can find trials:
Provide a keyword search bar where users can type conditions, medications, or other trial-related terms. As the user types, offer auto-complete suggestions enhanced by AI. For example, if a user’s profile says they have “Type 2 Diabetes,” the search box might suggest related terms like “diabetes neuropathy trial” or “GLP-1 agonist studies” to guide the user. Modern search UIs use predictive suggestions that consider context to help users formulate effective queries​
BLOOMREACH.COM
.
Include filter controls for location (e.g., radius or city/state), trial phase, and trial type. This lets users narrow results to, say, Phase 2 interventional trials near their city. ClinicalTrials.gov supports filtering by location and phase in its search API (e.g., limiting by location and specifying Phase 1–4)​
CLINICALTRIALS.GOV
​
CLINICALTRIALS.GOV
. The UI might use dropdowns or multi-selects so users can apply these criteria easily.
Build the Search Results Page: After a user searches, display the list of matching trials in a user-friendly format:
Show each trial’s key details at a glance – for example, the title of the study, its location(s) (or nearest location to the user), the trial phase (I–IV), and a brief description or condition focus. Including these details helps users quickly scan relevance.
Next to each trial, display an AI-generated summary that explains why this trial is a good match for the user. This summary should highlight connections to the user’s profile (e.g., “This trial involves a medication you’ve taken before and targets your condition, with eligibility matching your treatment history”). Such explanations make the relevance transparent, in line with research prototypes that output explanations for match scores​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Ensure the summary remains factual and concise.
Under each summary, provide one or more references or source links (for example, links to the trial registry or medical sources) that back up the AI’s statements. Citing sources for the summary adds transparency and trust – in clinical settings, AI responses should be verifiable against reliable sources​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. The user should be able to click a reference to review the original information (e.g. the ClinicalTrials.gov entry) that the AI used.
Create the AI Chatbot Interface: Develop a chat UI within the application for interactive help. The interface should allow users to type questions or messages and receive real-time responses (simulate a streaming response for a better experience). Include typical chat features like a conversation transcript, user message styling, and typing indicators for the AI bot.
Implement a mechanism to switch modes between a clinical trial assistant and a mental health support companion. For example, if the user asks factual questions like “What does this trial’s protocol mean?” the chatbot stays in assistant mode to explain or find trial details. If the user instead shares feelings or anxieties (“I’m nervous about participating in a trial”), the bot should switch to a support mode that offers empathy and coping suggestions. This could be achieved by classifying user inputs or using keywords to trigger the appropriate persona. Designing distinct response strategies for these modes is important because the chatbot needs to provide medical information in one case versus emotional support in the other​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Clearly indicate in the UI or chat context which mode is active (so the user knows the bot’s role).
Design the User Dashboard: Create an overview page for logged-in users that ties everything together. In the dashboard, allow users to:
View Saved Trials: Users can bookmark or save clinical trials they’re interested in. The dashboard should list these saved trials with the same key info (title, status, etc.), and perhaps an option to remove or click through to details.
Edit Medical Profile: Provide a section or link to update the user’s medical history and uploaded documents. This is important for keeping their data current – changes here could affect future search results. Ensure any changes are saved to the database securely.
Access Chatbot History: Show a history of the user’s conversations with the AI assistant (at least the recent interactions or allow them to open full history). This helps users recall advice given or revisit important information. For privacy, allow users to clear their chat history if desired.
Each of these frontend tasks should be built with responsiveness and accessibility in mind (Tailwind and ShadCN UI components are largely accessible by default). By completing these steps, the AI agent will have the user-facing part of the application where users can input information, search for trials, and interact with the AI assistant.
2. Backend Development Tasks
Set Up Supabase Backend: Use Supabase to configure the PostgreSQL database and authentication. This involves creating a Supabase project (which gives us a managed Postgres database with RESTful API access) and enabling Supabase Auth for user management. Supabase will handle user accounts, secure data storage, and file storage out of the box​
SUPABASE.COM
, which accelerates development of the backend.
User Registration & Auth API: Implement API routes (or use Supabase client libraries) for user sign-up and login. This includes endpoints or functions that call Supabase Auth (e.g., supabase.auth.signUp and signIn methods) so that the frontend can trigger registration or authentication requests. Ensure proper error handling (e.g., duplicate email, wrong password) and return meaningful messages to the frontend.
Medical History Data Endpoints: Develop endpoints to store and retrieve the user’s medical profile. For example, a POST /profile endpoint to save or update conditions, treatments, outcomes, etc., and a GET /profile to fetch the current data. These will interact with the database’s profile table (see schema design below) and should enforce that each user can only access their own profile (Supabase’s Row Level Security will help with this​
SUPABASE.COM
). The AI agent should ensure data is properly structured when stored (e.g., as JSON or relational records).
File Upload & Processing Service: Provide an API (or direct Supabase Storage integration) for uploading medical documents. The backend should accept file uploads (PDFs, images, etc.), store them in Supabase Storage or the database, and trigger a processing step. On upload, the system might use an LLM or OCR to parse the document’s content (for example, extracting text from a PDF or image). This processing could be done asynchronously – e.g., the file upload endpoint responds once the file is stored, and a background job or function then reads the file to extract relevant medical information (like conditions mentioned in a doctor’s note). The endpoint should return a reference to the stored file and any parsed data (or indicate that parsing is in progress).
Clinical Trials Fetching API: Integrate with the ClinicalTrials.gov API to retrieve trial data. Create endpoints such as GET /trials/search where the backend takes query parameters (keywords, location, phase filters) and calls the ClinicalTrials.gov API. The modern ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 returns JSON data for study records​
NLM.NIH.GOV
​
NLM.NIH.GOV
. The agent should parse the results to extract the fields needed (title, locations, phase, etc.). If the API doesn’t provide certain filters inherently, the backend can filter results post-fetch (for example, filter out trials by phase or distance from location if not directly supported by query). To avoid excessive load or API usage, implement caching for fetched results – e.g., store the last search results or frequently accessed trials in the database.
AI-Enhanced Search Queries: Create an endpoint (or internal service) that enhances user queries using AI. When a user searches for trials, before querying the external API, send the user’s query and perhaps a summary of their profile to an LLM endpoint. The LLM can expand or refine the query (for instance, add medical synonyms or related terms). For example, if a user searches "lung cancer trial," the AI might expand it to include specific types like "NSCLC EGFR inhibitor trial" if the profile suggests a particular subtype. This augmented query is then used to fetch more relevant trials. This endpoint should return the refined query and maybe an explanation of additions for transparency.
Ranking and Relevance Scoring: Implement an AI-driven ranking system as a backend service. When trial results are fetched, pass each trial and the user’s profile data to an LLM or a scoring algorithm. The LLM will analyze how well the trial matches the user (checking criteria like condition match, stage of disease, previous treatments, etc.) and produce a relevance score from 1 to 10. Research has shown that large language models like GPT-3.5 can effectively match patient descriptions to trial criteria by comparing the texts​
TRIOMICS.COM
. The service should also generate a short explanation for the score – for example, “Score: 8/10. The trial matches your condition and you meet most inclusion criteria, but it requires no prior treatment with Drug X, which you haven’t had​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
.” These explanations will be shown in the frontend as noted. To implement this, the agent might use prompt engineering (feed the LLM a structured prompt: “Here is patient info and trial info, rate 1-10 and explain reasons”). It’s important to set up guardrails so the LLM doesn’t produce overly lenient or strict scores; some calibration with sample profiles may be needed.
Chatbot Conversation Logging: Provide endpoints to store and retrieve chatbot interactions. For instance, when the user sends a message in the chat UI, the frontend calls a POST /chat endpoint with the message. The backend (or directly the frontend) gets a response from the LLM, and then the conversation (user query and AI answer, along with timestamps and mode info) is saved in a Chatbot Interactions table. Another endpoint GET /chat/history can return past conversations for the user. Storing the history server-side (rather than just in the browser) ensures the AI agent can analyze past interactions if needed (for context or continued conversations) and allows the user to see their history across devices. Make sure to sanitize and possibly encrypt sensitive parts of the conversation if they include personal health details.
Throughout these backend tasks, security and privacy are paramount. Supabase’s built-in features (like row-level security and storage permissions) will be used to ensure each user’s data and files are isolated​
SUPABASE.COM
. The AI components (LLM calls for query expansion or ranking) should also be handled carefully to avoid exposing sensitive data (use anonymized or minimum necessary info in prompts). By completing these backend services, the AI agent will enable the core logic of registration, data storage, trial fetching, and AI processing that powers the frontend.
3. Database Schema Design
Users Table: Define a table (or use Supabase Auth’s built-in user system) to store basic user info – at minimum, a unique user ID (UUID), email, and hashed password (if using email auth). If using Supabase Auth, this is handled in the auth.users table automatically​
SUPABASE.COM
 along with authentication metadata (sign-up timestamp, last login, etc.). Ensure this table is linked to the profile table via the user ID.
Medical Profile Table: This table stores detailed medical information for each user. Fields could include:
user_id (foreign key referencing Users),
conditions (text or JSON array of diagnosed conditions),
prior_treatments (text/JSON detailing treatments the user has undergone),
outcomes (text describing outcomes of those treatments),
side_effects (text or JSON of notable side effects experienced),
discontinuation_reasons (text explaining why any prior treatments were stopped),
documents (perhaps an array of file references or a separate table linking user_id to stored document metadata).
This structured layout allows the agent to query a user’s profile easily when matching trials. Using JSON columns for lists of items (conditions, treatments, etc.) can be convenient for flexibility. Apply row-level security so each user can only access their own profile row​
SUPABASE.COM
.
Clinical Trials Table: While the app fetches trials from an external API, having a table to cache and augment trial data is useful. This table can store:
trial_id (e.g., NCT number or an internal UUID),
key trial info (title, phase, location summary, condition, etc.),
the AI-generated ranking score for a given user (this might be in a separate join table keyed by user and trial if scores differ per user),
the AI explanation summary for that user’s match.
One approach is a UserTrialMatch table that links users to trials with fields for score and explanation. This way, multiple users can have separate scores for the same trial. Storing summaries and scores enables showing consistent results quickly without recomputing if the user revisits the results.
Search Queries Table: Logging search queries can help improve the system and track usage. Fields: user_id, query_text, filters (could be JSON containing location/phase filters applied), and timestamp. Each time a user searches, insert a record. This helps an AI agent analyze popular searches or refine the auto-suggest feature over time. It also allows users to possibly revisit recent searches.
Chatbot Interactions Table: Store chat history in a structured way. Fields might include: user_id, timestamp, message (the content of the user or bot message), and sender (indicating user or AI). If preserving the conversation thread order is important, another field could be a session or conversation ID, or simply rely on timestamps ordering. Storing the full conversation text allows the AI to retrieve context for continuity if needed (though the AI model might also maintain context short-term). Ensure this table too is protected per user.
Designing the schema in this way separates concerns and makes it clear how data flows: Users have one Profile, perform many Searches, get matched to many Trials, and engage in many Chatbot interactions. This normalization will help the AI agent handle data consistently. The schema should be implemented with proper indexes (e.g., index user_id in tables for faster joins, index trial identifiers for quick lookup by trial ID). Also consider size: documents might be large, so storing just references (file URLs from Supabase Storage) in the profile or a separate documents table is wiser than storing binary data in the table.
4. AI & LLM Integration Tasks
Medical Document Parsing with LLMs: Whenever a user uploads a medical document, use AI to extract structured information. For text PDFs or docs, this could involve sending the text to an LLM with prompts to find key details (diagnoses, medications, lab values, etc.). For images (say, a scan of a lab report), integrate an OCR step first (like using an open-source Tesseract or a Vision API to get text). The AI agent should then parse the text. Using specialized biomedical NLP tools can greatly aid this process – for example, libraries like SciSpaCy or BERN2 identify medical entities (diseases, genes, drugs) in unstructured text​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. The extracted data (e.g., a list of conditions mentioned in a doctor’s note) should be added to the user’s profile data. By automating document analysis, the system reduces the manual input burden on the user and ensures no key info is missed.
AI-Enhanced Search Query Generation: Implement logic to use the user’s profile context to improve search queries. For instance, before calling the trial API, an LLM can take the user’s query and profile summary and generate a more detailed query or additional keywords. If a user has a rare condition, the LLM might add synonyms or the medical term to the search. If the profile indicates a preference (like avoiding a certain medication), perhaps the LLM can include “not on XYZ drug” if such filtering is possible. Essentially, the agent acts like a smart query expander, using the patient’s history to make the ClinicalTrials.gov search more effective. This step should be done carefully to not introduce irrelevant terms. The LLM’s suggestions should be reviewed or constrained by rules (for example, only add terms directly related to the profile). This augmented query can be logged (in the Search Queries table) for transparency.
Trial Ranking via LLM: Use a large language model to compare each clinical trial’s criteria with the user’s data. The LLM (or a smaller custom model) will simulate what a physician or eligibility specialist does: check inclusion/exclusion criteria against the patient. For each trial, feed the model a prompt containing a summary of the trial’s key criteria and the user’s profile, and ask for a relevance score 1–10 with an explanation. This is akin to how recent research matched patients to trials using LLMs – by parsing trial protocols and patient info to see if they fit​
TRIOMICS.COM
. The output explanation should cite specific criteria matches or mismatches (e.g., “Patient has condition X required by trial; age is within range; however, patient took Drug Y which excludes them”). The system from a pilot study delivered a matching score with evidence for inclusion/exclusion, which is exactly our approach​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Implement this with either OpenAI’s GPT-4 (if available via API) or an open-source model hosted on the backend for privacy. This task may also involve fine-tuning: if using an open-source model, you might train it on example patient-trial pairs to improve accuracy​
TRIOMICS.COM
.
Chatbot Response Generation: Integrate the LLM to power the chatbot’s replies in two distinct modes:
In Clinical Trial Assistant mode, the chatbot answers questions about trials, explains medical terms, or helps navigate the app. It should use a retrieval-augmented approach: for factual questions, query a knowledge base (like fetched trial details or a medical database) so that the answers are grounded in real data. For example, if asked “What does Phase 2 mean?”, the bot can retrieve a definition of Phase 2 trials and respond with that information, citing a source. Ensuring answers are source-backed will increase user trust and reduce errors​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. The agent might use prompt templates that include relevant documentation (trial criteria text, etc.) in the LLM’s context for accuracy.
In Mental Health Support mode, the chatbot focuses on empathetic, encouraging dialogue. It should recognize cues of user distress or anxiety and respond with appropriate tone – for instance, using techniques from counseling (validation, positivity, suggesting coping strategies). This mode should not offer medical advice beyond support (and certainly no diagnoses or prescriptions). AI chatbots in mental health have shown they can provide non-judgmental space and encourage users to share feelings​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. The LLM can be prompted with a specific persona (e.g., “You are a supportive companion for someone dealing with health stress”). It may also include guidelines to escalate or suggest professional help if the user mentions suicidal ideation or a crisis (basic safety net logic).
Safety and Hallucination Mitigation: Put strong safeguards in place for all AI outputs:
Source Verification: For trial-related answers, the bot should provide references or clearly indicate the information source (like linking the trial data or literature). This allows users to verify claims, an approach recommended to catch AI misinformation in clinical scenarios​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. If the LLM provides a piece of info without a source, consider post-processing the answer to either remove it or flag it.
Content Filtering: Utilize AI content moderation tools or rules to filter inappropriate or harmful outputs. For instance, if a user in mental health mode expresses self-harm, the system should recognize this and respond with an encouraged action to seek immediate help (and not output anything harmful). Both modes should avoid any offensive or biased language. The AI agent might use OpenAI’s moderation API or a custom filter to check responses before they are shown.
No Medical Hallucinations: In health applications, making up treatments or incorrect facts is dangerous. Constrain the LLM with a smaller context of only known information (for example, only feed it the trial text and user data, nothing else). Additionally, instruct the model (via the prompt) to say “I don’t know” or suggest consulting a professional when it’s unsure. The agent should prefer accuracy over creativity here. As an extra layer, have a validation step: if the LLM says the user is eligible for a trial, double-check key criteria programmatically if possible.
Explainability: Encourage the LLM to explain its reasoning in the background (especially for the ranking). This can be logged for developers to review why the AI gave certain recommendations. Such transparency can help debug any odd suggestions and improve the prompts or model if needed. In summary, the AI integration will combine natural language understanding with strict oversight to ensure the outcomes are factual, relevant, and supportive.
5. Deployment & Security
Frontend Deployment (Vercel): Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel, which is a seamless process for Next apps​
UI.SHADCN.COM
. Vercel will automatically build and host the app with optimal settings (including global CDN for assets, serverless functions support if needed, and environment variable configuration for API keys). Make sure to set up environment vars on Vercel for anything like Supabase keys or API endpoints. Using Vercel ensures the app is served over HTTPS by default, which is crucial for protecting user data in transit.
Backend and Database Hosting: Host the Supabase backend (Postgres DB, auth, storage) through Supabase’s cloud service. The Supabase project will live on their servers with managed scaling and security. All traffic to Supabase (database queries, auth calls) is encrypted via TLS​
SUPABASE.COM
. If any custom backend code (like an API server or serverless functions for the AI processing) is needed beyond what can run in Vercel or Supabase Edge Functions, consider deploying that on a platform like AWS Lambda or Fly.io. However, Supabase itself can cover a lot: it has serverless function support (Supabase Edge Functions) which can run the custom logic (like calling the LLM or processing files) close to the database.
Secure Communication: Ensure the frontend uses the Supabase client library in a secure manner, always using HTTPS calls to the Supabase endpoints. For external API calls (ClinicalTrials.gov or LLM API), use HTTPS endpoints as well. In production, obtain and enforce SSL certificates for any custom domain on Vercel (Vercel provides this automatically). This prevents any interception of sensitive info like auth tokens or personal data.
Access Control & RLS: Leverage role-based access control so that users can only access their data. In practice, Supabase’s row-level security policies will enforce that, for example, a user_id column match is required on profile and records queries​
SUPABASE.COM
. Set up these policies using SQL in Supabase (e.g., policy for profiles: allow select/update if user_id = auth.uid()). Also restrict file storage rules: each user’s uploaded documents should be in a private bucket or path, and only that user (with their Supabase auth token) can fetch them. Supabase storage can be configured with bucket-level policies for this.
Data Encryption: All sensitive data in the database (especially medical history and documents) should be encrypted at rest. Supabase by default encrypts data at rest with AES-256 on their servers​
SUPABASE.COM
. For extra security on particularly sensitive fields (perhaps the text of doctor’s notes), consider using the PG encryption extension (like Supabase Vault or pgcrypto) to encrypt those fields in the database so that even if the DB is accessed, the content is not in plaintext. Also, ensure that any file uploads are stored encrypted (Supabase Storage or the underlying S3 has server-side encryption).
API Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse or DDoS-like behavior. For instance, the search endpoint should limit how many searches per minute a user can perform, and the chat endpoint should throttle rapid message sends. This can be done via middleware in Next.js API routes or using an API gateway. Rate limiting is a best practice to protect against overload and ensure fair use​
DEVELOPERS.CLOUDFLARE.COM
. If using Vercel serverless functions, one might integrate a library or service (like Upstash Redis QStash or Cloudflare) to count requests. Also, enforce size limits on requests (to prevent someone from sending an extremely large profile document that could crash the system).
Other Security Best Practices: Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities. Use Supabase’s logging and monitoring to detect unusual activities. Back up the database periodically. For user account security, encourage strong passwords and possibly offer 2FA if Supabase supports it. On the Next.js side, use Helmet or appropriate headers to enforce security policies (Content Security Policy to restrict script sources, etc., especially since the app deals with sensitive info). Conduct a security audit pass – using tools or manual review – before deployment to catch any overlooked issues (like ensuring no sensitive info is logged in plaintext, etc.). By deploying with these measures in place, the AI agent ensures the application is not only functional but also trustworthy and compliant with privacy expectations.
6. Testing & Optimization
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for both frontend and backend logic. On the frontend, test React components and utility functions – e.g., ensure the Profile form updates state correctly, or the Search bar calls the suggest API when typing. Use frameworks like Jest or Vitest with React Testing Library for components. Next.js recommends unit tests for isolated logic and components​
NEXTJS.ORG
. For the backend, test each API endpoint function: for example, simulate a call to the profile save endpoint with sample data and verify the database interaction (this might be done with a test database or mocking the DB). Also test helper functions like the LLM prompt generators or scoring algorithm using sample inputs to see if outputs make sense.
Integration & End-to-End Testing: Conduct end-to-end tests that mimic real user flows in a staging environment. For example, using a tool like Cypress or Playwright, script a scenario where a user signs up, fills in profile info, searches for a trial, views results, and interacts with the chatbot. This ensures all pieces work together (frontend forms correctly call backend, which returns expected data, etc.). Next.js documentation highlights E2E testing for full flows in a realistic environment​
NEXTJS.ORG
. Also test edge cases: no search results (the app should display “no trials found” gracefully), or the chatbot mode switching (e.g., input a clearly emotional statement and verify the bot responds in support mode). Don’t forget to test on multiple device sizes for responsive design issues.
Database and API Testing: Use unit tests or script to run through database queries and ensure schema works. For instance, insert a dummy user and profile, then run the matching logic against a dummy trial entry to see that the ranking system can handle it. Additionally, test the ClinicalTrials.gov API integration by calling it with known queries (maybe using a recorded or sandbox response if available) to ensure the parsing logic handles the JSON structure. If the app caches data, test cache hit vs miss scenarios.
AI Output Evaluation: Since AI components are non-deterministic, do manual testing of the LLM outputs. Prepare a few sample user profiles and have the system fetch trials and produce rankings and summaries. Evaluate if the summaries are factually correct and the scores seem reasonable. If you find issues (e.g., the explanation cites a condition the user doesn’t have), refine the prompts or fix the parsing of profile data fed to the LLM. It’s also helpful to have a medical expert review a few outputs if possible, given the high stakes. For the chatbot, test both modes by simulating conversations. Ensure that in assistant mode, factual questions get accurate answers with references, and in support mode, the tone is empathetic and safe. Any questionable or hallucinated response should be traced and addressed either by tweaking the AI prompt or adding to the moderation filters.
Performance Optimization: Optimize both the web app and the AI calls:
On the frontend, enable Next.js performance optimizations like image optimization for any icons/avatars, code-splitting to load pages faster, and possibly offline caching for static assets.
For the AI calls, reduce latency by minimizing data sent. For example, when sending profile data to the LLM, send a summary or only the relevant fields rather than the entire raw text of documents every time. Use streaming responses for the chatbot so the user sees the answer as it’s generated, improving perceived speed.
Implement caching for expensive operations. Cache the results of a trial search (for a given query and filters) for a short time so that if the user repeats a search or refines it slightly, it doesn’t hit the external API each time. Likewise, cache LLM results for identical inputs (though exact repeats may be rare). Even caching the AI’s analysis of each trial eligibility could be useful: if user A and user B have very similar profiles, the system might reuse parts of the analysis for a given trial.
Monitor the response times and use of the AI. If the LLM API calls become a bottleneck, consider batching some operations (for instance, ask the LLM to evaluate multiple trials in one call by providing a list, if the context window allows). Also consider using a smaller, faster model for auto-suggestions and use the bigger model only for the more complex tasks like personalized ranking or long chatbot responses.
Fine-Tuning and Feedback: As users start using the system, collect feedback implicitly or explicitly. For example, if users consistently skip certain trial suggestions or delete them from saved, that might indicate the relevance scoring can improve. Consider a mechanism for users to thumbs-up/down a trial recommendation or correct the chatbot. Over time, use this data to fine-tune the AI components. Fine-tuning could mean training an open-source model on a growing dataset of user profiles and trials with known outcomes (as in the study that fine-tuned LLMs for trial matching​
TRIOMICS.COM
), or it could mean adjusting prompt weights (like explicitly telling the LLM to prioritize certain criteria more). Continually iterate on the AI prompts and scoring algorithm to boost precision and user satisfaction.
Usability Testing: Besides technical tests, have a few users or testers go through the app to provide qualitative feedback. This can reveal if any part of the flowchart or task sequence is confusing to users. For example, maybe users expect to see something on the dashboard that isn’t there, or they don’t realize they can scroll the chat. Such insights can lead to UI/UX adjustments even if the functional tests pass.
By systematically testing each part and then optimizing, the AI agent will ensure the application runs smoothly, accurately, and efficiently. Optimization is an ongoing process – especially the AI’s performance – so monitoring tools (for error rates, response times, and user behavior analytics) should be in place when the app is live.
