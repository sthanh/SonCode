1. Overview
Purpose: The purpose of this platform is to assist patients and caregivers in navigating the complex world of clinical trials by matching them with the best options based on their detailed medical history. It aims to empower users with personalized information so they can make informed decisions about potential clinical trial opportunities. Scope: This will be a user-friendly, web-based SaaS platform accessible via a browser. The initial scope is focused on manual user input and document uploads rather than integrating with electronic health record (EHR) systems. Users will enter their medical details or upload relevant medical records, and the system will use that information to tailor the clinical trial search. By avoiding direct EHR integration, we reduce complexity and privacy concerns while still allowing users to provide comprehensive medical background information. Key Features: Key features of the platform include:
Clinical Trial Search: A search interface that lets users find clinical trials by keywords (e.g., condition, drug name, location) using data from ClinicalTrials.gov and other open research databases.
AI-Driven Ranking: An AI-based system ranks search results on a 1 to 10 scale for relevance to the user’s profile, highlighting the trials that best match the individual’s medical history and needs.
Explainable AI Summaries: For each recommended trial, the platform provides a concise summary (generated by AI) explaining the trial in plain language and why it might be relevant, including key criteria and references to sources.
AI Chatbot for Support: An integrated conversational AI assistant to answer user questions, provide emotional support, and clarify medical jargon. It can act as a friendly guide or even a virtual therapist for general stress related to health.
Intuitive User Interface: A clean, intuitive UI/UX designed for people who may not be tech-savvy. The interface will guide users through entering their information, searching, and understanding results with ease.
2. User Roles & Authentication
Primary Users: The platform is designed primarily for patients seeking clinical trials for themselves, and caregivers who may be searching on behalf of a patient (e.g., family members). Both have the same access and capabilities on the platform; there are no separate role-based features at this stage. Every user essentially has the same role – a seeker of clinical trial information.
Access Control: At this initial phase, we will not implement multiple user roles or permission levels. All authenticated users can create a profile, search for trials, and use the chatbot. (Administrative access for developers/maintainers is outside the scope of this user-facing document.)
Authentication Method: User accounts and authentication will be handled via Supabase Auth. Users will sign up with an email and password (and possibly OAuth options if provided by Supabase, such as Google login). This ensures a secure and simple login process. No anonymous usage of personalized features – users should be logged in so their profile data can be saved and used for matching. However, basic trial search might be allowed without login (to encourage exploration), but saving favorites or getting personalized rankings would require an account.
Security: Although we are not dealing with EHR integration, users may input sensitive health information. All account data and profile information will be stored securely in our database (PostgreSQL via Supabase) with appropriate access rules so that each user can only access their own data. Supabase will handle password hashing and management to industry standards.
3. Core Functionalities
User Profile Management
Manual Medical History Input: Users can manually enter their medical details through form fields. This includes diagnoses (e.g., specific cancer type or condition), disease stage or severity, previous treatments or medications taken, and outcomes of those treatments (for example, noting if a medication was ineffective or had certain side effects). We will also allow users to rate or describe how well each prior treatment worked for them, giving a sense of effectiveness or reason for discontinuation.
Medical Record Uploads: For users who have detailed medical records (such as doctor’s notes, lab results, or discharge summaries), the platform provides an option to upload these documents (PDFs, text files, images of documents, etc.). This is optional but can greatly enhance the profile. Upon upload, the system will use a large language model (LLM) in the backend to parse and interpret these documents. The LLM can extract key information like diagnosed conditions, treatments received, dates, outcomes, and even doctor’s reasoning or notes on why certain treatments were stopped. This saves the user time in manual data entry and ensures nuanced details aren’t missed.
AI Interpretation of Records: The LLM-driven component will analyze uploaded medical records to identify prior therapies and the context around them. For example, if a record mentions that a patient stopped a medication due to severe side effects, the system will capture both the treatment and the reason for discontinuation. All extracted information will be added to the user’s profile (after user confirmation for accuracy). This interpreted data will later inform the search and ranking algorithms, ensuring the platform doesn’t recommend trials for treatments similar to ones that failed or caused issues before, if avoidable.
Profile Privacy and Editing: Users can review and edit their profile information at any time. All data entered or extracted will be visible to the user in an organized profile dashboard. They can correct any mistakes in AI-extracted data and update their history as their condition evolves (for instance, if they start a new medication or get a new diagnosis, they can add that).
Clinical Trial Search & Matching
Keyword-Based Search: The core of the application is a search engine that allows users to look for clinical trials. Users can enter keywords such as the name of their condition (e.g., “metastatic breast cancer”), a specific gene mutation or biomarker, a treatment name, or location preferences. The system will query the ClinicalTrials.gov API (and potentially other open trial databases) to fetch current clinical trials that match those terms. Results will include key details from the trials: title, summary, phase (I, II, III, etc.), location(s), status (recruiting or not), and a link to the official listing.
AI-Enhanced Query Refinement: In addition to straightforward keyword matching, the search function will be augmented by AI. The platform’s LLM will take into account the user’s profile information to automatically refine the search. For example, if a patient’s profile indicates they have already tried a certain medication, the LLM might add a filter to exclude trials that involve that same medication (assuming the patient likely wants alternatives). Or if the profile mentions a specific genetic marker, the AI might include that in the search query to find trials targeting that marker. This contextual search helps surface trials that a user might not know to search for themselves. The user will have the ability to see and adjust these AI-recommended filters or terms for transparency.
Search Results Display: Trials retrieved from the API will be displayed in a list with key information visible. Each listing will show the trial name, a short description, phase, location, and a relevance score (described below). Users can sort or filter results further (e.g., by distance from their location or by trial phase).
AI-Powered Ranking (Relevance Score): Each trial result will be accompanied by a relevance score from 1 to 10, generated by our AI ranking system. This score indicates how well the trial matches the user’s specific medical profile and needs – 10 meaning “excellent match” and 1 meaning “poor match.” The ranking algorithm will consider factors such as: the trial’s inclusion/exclusion criteria against the user’s data, the phase of the trial (for example, a patient who has exhausted standard treatments might be more suited for a Phase II/III trial of a new drug), location proximity if that’s a factor, and whether the trial addresses a similar patient history. An explanation will be provided alongside the score, for example: “Rated 9/10 because the trial targets [condition] in patients who have tried [treatment X] which matches your history.” This transparency helps users trust the AI’s recommendations.
Summarized Insights and Explainable Summaries: Clicking on a trial (or expanding it) will show an AI-generated summary of the trial. This summary will explain in layman’s terms what the trial is investigating, what the treatment or intervention is, and why it might be relevant to the user. Importantly, it will highlight parts of the trial that match the user profile, such as “This trial is for patients with [specific mutation], which you have,” or “This study is looking for patients who have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, which aligns with your treatment history.” The summary will also mention any critical eligibility criteria (for instance, age limits or required health status) to help the user quickly assess fit.
Incorporating Research Papers: Beyond trial registry data, the platform will augment information with relevant research. For instance, if a trial is testing a particular new drug, the system can pull in open-access research papers or PubMed abstracts about that drug or similar trials. It will then generate a short insight like: “A 2023 study (Smith et al.) showed this drug had promising results in early trials for your cancer type.” These insights give users more context about why a trial could be promising. All such summaries will be concise and written in user-friendly language, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
References and Source Citations: To ensure accuracy and build trust, any AI-generated content (trial summaries, research insights, etc.) will include citations or references. For example, a summary might end with references like (Trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT123456) or (Source: Smith et al. 2023, Journal of Oncology). Users can click these to view the original source (trial listing or research paper) if they want more detail. This approach helps minimize AI hallucinations because the AI is instructed to base its output on verifiable sources. If the AI cannot find a source for certain information, it will not include that information in the summary.
No Hallucination Policy: As part of the requirement, the AI should avoid making unsupported claims. The system will double-check that any specific detail (like a statistic or outcome) it presents in a summary was present in the source material. If the confidence is low, it will either omit that detail or flag it for the user to verify.
AI Chatbot for Support & Mental Health
Purpose of Chatbot: The platform will have an AI-powered chatbot available to users for two main purposes: (1) to answer questions about clinical trials and medical information, and (2) to provide emotional support and guidance as users navigate what can be a stressful process. This dual role means the chatbot is both a medical guide and a mental health companion.
Context-Aware Assistance: When users are actively exploring trials or reading summaries, they can ask the chatbot questions like “Am I eligible for this trial?” or “What does immunotherapy mean in this context?” The chatbot will use the context (the page the user is on, the user’s profile if permitted, and relevant medical knowledge) to give accurate, helpful answers. For example, it might explain eligibility criteria in simpler terms or retrieve a specific detail from the trial description if the user asks about it.
Personalized Responses: Because the chatbot can access the user’s profile (with user permission), it can personalize its answers or support. If a user says “I’m feeling unsure about joining a trial,” the chatbot can respond with empathy and perhaps reference something from their profile: “I understand. You’ve been through treatments like X and Y already; it’s normal to feel uncertain about trying something new. Many patients in your situation feel the same way, and here are a couple of things to consider…”. This personal touch can make the support feel more genuine.
Mental Health Support Mode: If a user engages the chatbot in a more open-ended conversation not directly tied to a specific trial (for instance, “I’m really scared about the future” or “I just need someone to talk to”), the chatbot will switch to a compassionate, therapist-like approach. It will employ well-established strategies from cognitive-behavioral therapy and supportive listening: encouraging the user to express feelings, validating those feelings, and offering coping suggestions or positivity. While it is not a replacement for a licensed therapist, it serves as a readily available listener that can help alleviate anxiety in the moment.
Medical Topic Explanations: The chatbot will excel at breaking down complex medical terms or concepts into plain language. If a user asks something like “What is a Phase II trial?” or “How does CAR-T therapy work?”, the chatbot will provide a clear, concise explanation appropriate for a layperson. It will avoid overly technical language and can use analogies to make the concept easier to grasp. This educational aspect ensures users are not left confused by jargon they encounter during their research.
Safety and Tone: The chatbot is designed to maintain a reassuring and non-judgmental tone. It will not give medical advice that overrides a doctor’s guidance; instead, it will offer information and suggest that users consult healthcare professionals for decisions. All responses will have a bias towards hope, realism, and encouragement. Importantly, if a user brings up a mental health crisis (e.g., mentions self-harm or extreme despair), the chatbot will provide gentle encouragement to seek professional help and, if possible, surface resources or help lines (this is a safety consideration, though this is not a core feature in the initial version, it should be planned for).
4. Tech Stack
Frontend: The front-end will be built with Next.js (React framework) using TypeScript for type safety and reliability of the code. Styling will be handled with Tailwind CSS to allow rapid UI development with a consistent design system. We will also utilize ShadCN UI (a component library that works with Tailwind) for pre-built accessible UI components such as forms, modals, and dropdowns, ensuring the interface is polished and consistent. This stack ensures a responsive, modern single-page application experience for users.
Backend & Database: We will use Supabase as the backend platform, which provides a PostgreSQL database and serverless functions out-of-the-box. Supabase will store user profiles, including medical history inputs and any metadata about uploaded documents (the documents themselves might be stored in Supabase storage or an S3 bucket). The database will also store user query history, favorite trials (if we add such a feature), and logs of AI interactions (for improving the model and auditing). Using Supabase streamlines development since it offers a managed Postgres and integrates well with Next.js via APIs.
Authentication: Supabase Auth will handle user authentication. It supports email/password sign-up, secure session handling, and password reset flows out-of-the-box, which we can easily integrate into the Next.js app. This saves us from implementing our own auth and ensures robust security standards. We might also enable social logins (like Google or Apple) through Supabase Auth if desired to simplify onboarding.
AI & Search Services: The platform’s intelligence relies on several external services/APIs:
OpenAI API (or similar LLM): We plan to use a large language model (like GPT-4 or another provider/model) via API to power the AI summaries, the chatbot, and the interpretation of uploaded documents. This will handle tasks like summarizing trial info, parsing medical text, and engaging in conversation. If needed for cost or privacy reasons, we could explore open-source models that we host ourselves in the future, but initially OpenAI’s API offers quick setup and state-of-the-art language understanding.
ClinicalTrials.gov API: To fetch clinical trial listings, we will utilize the official ClinicalTrials.gov API (which provides endpoints to query trials by condition, location, etc.). This ensures we have up-to-date trial information without hosting our own database of trials. We may need to periodically update or cache results for performance. Additionally, we can integrate other databases or APIs if available for trials (for example, NIH or international trial registries) to broaden the search.
Research Papers and Data: For pulling research abstracts or papers, we might use APIs like the Semantic Scholar API, PubMed E-utilities, or CrossRef to find relevant publications based on keywords (like condition and treatment). If an API is not sufficient (for example, to get the latest conference findings), we could implement web scraping of known open-access journals or preprint servers. However, we must do this responsibly and within legal bounds (scraping only content that is publicly accessible and not behind paywalls, or using official RSS feeds).
Hosting and Serverless Functions: The Next.js frontend (and any serverless API routes or functions it includes) will likely be hosted on Vercel for ease of deployment and scalability. Supabase functions could also be used for any custom backend logic (like processing an uploaded PDF through the AI). These choices allow us to scale specific parts of the stack (e.g., increasing resources for the database or the function that calls the AI) without over-provisioning the whole system.
5. Scalability & Performance
User Concurrency Expectations: Initially, the expected user base is small (a pilot group or early adopters). We do not anticipate heavy concurrent usage in the early stages of the product. Therefore, our development will prioritize correctness and completeness of features over heavy optimization. The stack chosen (Vercel, Supabase, external APIs) can handle moderate load by default. If our user base grows unexpectedly fast, these managed services can scale up with relatively little configuration (for example, upgrading the database plan or enabling more serverless function instances).
Performance Considerations: Even with low load, we will implement basic performance best practices to ensure a smooth user experience. This includes caching frequent API calls where possible – for example, caching results from ClinicalTrials.gov for popular queries to avoid slow responses or rate limits. Also, the AI requests to OpenAI will be managed to prevent long waits; we might show a loading indicator and process some tasks (like document parsing or summarization) asynchronously so the UI remains responsive. Frontend code will be optimized via Next.js features (like static generation for landing pages, code-splitting, etc.).
Scalability of AI Components: One performance bottleneck could be the AI services (OpenAI API calls), which have latency and cost. To manage this, we will queue or rate-limit AI requests if a single user is making many back-to-back queries. We’ll also monitor usage to preemptively scale our plan with the API provider if needed. If usage grows, we might explore hosting an LLM or using a cheaper/faster model for less critical tasks. All these measures ensure that even as more users join, the system remains stable and responsive.
Cloud Deployment: By using Vercel and Supabase (which in turn runs on a cloud infrastructure), we inherently have a setup that can scale vertically and horizontally. Vercel can handle spikes in traffic by replicating the frontend across their edge network. Supabase’s database can be scaled to a larger instance or a cluster if needed, and their storage can handle more files as users upload more documents. This cloud-native approach allows us to meet performance needs without needing to manually provision servers.
No Premature Optimization: We acknowledge that at this stage, it’s more important to validate the product idea and user experience than to architect for millions of users. Thus, complex optimizations (like multi-region deployments, elaborate load balancing, or heavy use of caching layers) will be deferred until we have a proven demand for them. We will, however, keep the codebase and architecture modular enough to extend or optimize when the time comes.
6. Compliance & Legal Considerations
Disclaimers (Not Medical Advice): Since our platform deals with health information and suggests clinical trials, it is critical to include clear disclaimers. The UI will prominently inform users that this platform is a research and educational tool only and not a substitute for professional medical advice or a doctor’s recommendation. For example, on the results page or in the chatbot window, we might display a note like: “This platform is for informational purposes and is not a certified medical device. Always consult your healthcare provider before making medical decisions.” This protects users and the company by setting the right expectations.
Regulatory Scope: By not integrating with EHRs and by being user-driven (users input their own data), we avoid directly handling regulated medical records under laws like HIPAA. However, any personal health information users provide is still sensitive. We will enforce data encryption at rest (Supabase provides this by default for the database) and in transit (HTTPS for all connections) to protect user privacy. If we later consider making the product a formal “medical device” (software that guides treatment decisions), we would need to undergo regulatory approval (FDA, etc.), but that is out of scope for now. We are explicitly positioning the product as a helper tool, not as a diagnostic or treatment decision system.
Data Privacy: In our terms of service and privacy policy, we will outline what data we collect (e.g., profile info, uploaded documents), how it’s used (to personalize trial searches and chatbot interactions), and how it’s stored. We will not share user identifiable data with any third parties. If we use analytics, it will be anonymized. Users should also be able to delete their account and data if they wish (we will include a data deletion mechanism as part of account settings).
AI Usage Transparency: We should inform users that AI is being used to generate summaries and chat responses. This could be in the form of a small note or icon indicating “AI-generated content” so users know that while we strive for accuracy, the responses come from an AI. This transparency is both an ethical consideration and helps set expectations about possible errors.
No Partnerships or Endorsements: Currently, the platform has no official partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, or patient advocacy groups. All trial information is sourced impartially from public databases. We will make it clear that listing a trial doesn’t imply an endorsement by our platform, and conversely, we are not endorsed by any third parties either. This avoids any conflict of interest concerns. In the future, if we form partnerships (for example, a collaboration with a hospital to get their trial data or funding from a foundation), we will update the PRD and user-facing information accordingly.
Intellectual Property and Content Use: We should ensure we have the rights to use any content we present. For example, summarizing a research paper is usually fine, but we shouldn’t display large excerpts from proprietary papers that aren’t open-access. Similarly, using ClinicalTrials.gov data is generally allowed since it’s public domain, but we’ll still adhere to any usage guidelines they have.
7. SEO & Discovery Strategy
Search Engine Optimization: To help patients and caregivers discover this platform, we will implement SEO best practices from day one. This means our public-facing pages (landing page, about page, possibly a blog or learning center) will be optimized with keywords that our target audience might search for. Examples include “find clinical trials for [disease]”, “clinical trial matching service”, “how to join a clinical trial”, etc. We will incorporate these phrases naturally into the site’s content and metadata. Using Next.js will help since we can server-side render or statically generate pages with proper <meta> tags for description and keywords.
Content Marketing and Education: As part of discovery, we plan to include an educational section or blog on the site with articles about the clinical trial process, success stories, tips for applying to trials, and so forth. These articles will not only help users but also improve SEO by targeting long-tail keywords and establishing the site as an authority on clinical trial navigation. For example, an article titled “5 Tips to Find Clinical Trials for Rare Diseases” could draw in a niche audience.
Social and Community Presence: Although not a core requirement for the product functionality, having a presence where patients and caregivers gather online can boost discovery. We might consider creating a supportive social media profile or participating in forums (like a subreddit or patient advocacy group discussions) to softly promote the tool. Any such efforts will maintain a helpful tone rather than pure advertising.
Brand Naming & Identity: A memorable and relevant name is part of SEO and user recall. We aim to choose a name for the application that is easy to remember, easy to spell, and evokes trust and compassion. The name should resonate with someone looking for help in a medical journey and ideally hint at the purpose (trials, guidance, support). We will secure an appropriate domain name for it as well. For example, if the name is “TrialNavigator,” we’d use that in the URL for consistency. The branding (logo, color scheme) will further reflect a warm, hopeful, and professional identity — likely using calming colors and clear imagery (perhaps a compass, a path, or a heart, symbolizing care).
Visibility to Target Users: We will also reach out to patient advocacy groups, online communities, and possibly healthcare providers with information about the platform once it’s ready. Word-of-mouth and recommendations by trusted community leaders can significantly help discovery. These efforts, while more in the marketing plan realm, tie back to product design in ensuring we have shareable resources (like an easily sharable link to a trial result or a printable summary) that encourage users to talk about and share the product.
8. Business Model
Free to Use (Launch Phase): At launch, the platform will be completely free for end-users. We want to eliminate any financial barrier for patients and caregivers who could benefit from the service. The focus is on accumulating users, understanding their needs, and proving the value of the product. Monetizing too early could slow adoption, especially in a sensitive area like healthcare where users might be skeptical of a paid service that isn’t yet proven.
Value Proposition: By keeping it free, we aim to provide maximum value: personalized trial matching, information, and support, all in one place. This value will help us build a loyal user base and gather success stories or testimonials (e.g., a patient found a trial that improved their outcome). These successes are crucial for long-term credibility.
Future Monetization Ideas: While not implemented initially, we are considering future business models to sustain the platform:
Premium Features: For example, a paid tier could offer one-on-one support from a human clinical trial navigator or faster AI responses/higher usage limits, or perhaps integration with specialized services like genetic testing information.
Partnerships: We might partner with research organizations or pharmaceutical companies in a way that does not compromise user trust. For instance, a partnership could involve a company sponsoring the platform for a particular disease area (providing funding in exchange for us building out more features for those users). We will tread carefully here to avoid any bias – user trust is paramount.
Referrals: In some healthcare services, there’s a referral commission if a patient enrolls in a trial or a program via a platform. We could explore this ethically, ensuring that any such arrangements do not skew the impartiality of our trial recommendations. If implemented, we would fully disclose sponsored listings or paid referrals to users.
Data Insights: Aggregated, anonymized data about what trials patients search for or find appealing could be valuable to researchers. We might consider selling insights or reports (never individual data) to stakeholders like research institutions to help them understand patient interest. However, this would be down the line and only if it aligns with our mission.
Operational Costs and Sustainability: In the short term, we will cover costs (for hosting, API usage like OpenAI, etc.) perhaps through seed funding or grants (since this platform has a public-good aspect). Keeping it free means we need to monitor costs carefully (e.g., optimize AI calls to avoid unnecessary expenses). As the user base grows, we’ll revisit the business model to ensure we can sustain and scale the service without compromising on quality or trust.
